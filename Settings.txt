# 'TypeHeading' defines wether the Heading should be typed as well.
# Settings are True (enabled) and False (disabled)

TypeHeading=True

# Enable 'LowFpsMode' when you play Warthunder with less than 25 FPS. CoverMe will wait
# significantly longer between pushing down and releasing the return key to type the 
# message, allowing the Update-logic of Warthunder to detect that the key was indeed pressed
# during a frame-cycle on slow computers.

LowFpsMode=False

# If the SmartTrigger is enabled, whenever you press T-4-1 or T-4-2 (with a maximum of 
# 1 second in between the strokes), CoverMe will be triggered. If the SmartTrigger is
# disabled, CoverMe will be triggered when pressing the key defined by 'Trigger'
# Settings are True (enabled) and False (disabled)

# The following settings only apply when SmartTrigger is enabled
# 'TeamQuickChatKey' and 'SquadQuickChatKey' define which keys are used to open the quick
# chat menu for both team and squad chat, as the name suggests. If you do not want to use 
# both, bind them to the same key. (Imagine you only want to print altitude when using team 
# chat, bind both team- and squad-chat to VK_T, that is if you are using the default 'T'-
# key for team-quickchat)

TeamQuickChatKey=VK_T
SquadQuickChatKey=VK_K

# 'SmartTriggerTimeout' is the amount of miliseconds that can pass in between keystrokes.
# For example if this setting is 1000, between each of the strokes T-4-2 a maximum of 1
# second may pass, otherwise it will not be detected

# The following settings only apply when SmartTrigger is disabled
# 'Trigger' is the virtual key code of the key that triggers CoverMe
